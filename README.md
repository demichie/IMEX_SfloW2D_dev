# Depth-averaged gas-particles model

Shallow water model for multiphase flow (gas+particles) with density of gas
temperature-dependent.

To compile the code you need a Fortran compiler and the NetCDF library for Fortran. You can install both with anaconda, by creating an anaconda environment and activating it:

> conda create -n fortran_env conda-forge::gfortran_linux-64  sysroot_linux-64  make  conda-forge::netcdf-fortran  conda-forge::liblapack  conda-forge::libblas
> 
> conda activate fortran_env

or, on a osx computer:

> conda create -n fortran_env conda-forge::gfortran make conda-forge::netcdf-fortran conda-forge::liblapack conda-forge::libblas
> 
> conda activate fortran_env


To compile:

> autoreconf -i

Then on linux (replace USERNAME with you user account):

> ./configure --with-netcdf=/home/USERNAME/anaconda3/envs/fortran_env

On OSX (replace USERNAME with you user account):

> ./configure --with-netcdf=/USERS/USERNAME/anaconda3/envs/fortran_env

To compile the code with OpenMP add the following flag in src/Makefile:
1) with gfortran: -fopenmp
2) with intel: -qopenmp

> make

> make install

The executable is copied in the bin folder.

Several examples can be found in the EXAMPLES folder.
